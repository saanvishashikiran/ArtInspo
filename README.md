# Art Inspiration Flask Web App

I love to draw and paint, but sometimes finding inspiration is difficult, and this stops me from creating art at all! This web app is helpful because it acts as an endless source of inspiration. If the sunset that the app generated is not your favorite, simply ask for another. Don't let droughts of creativity stop you from engaging in your favorite hobby!

- This is a simple web app built with **Python Flask** that helps users find art inspiration by fetching random images from different categories using the **Pexels API**.
- Users select a category from a dropdown and get a fresh image sourced directly from Pexels to spark creativity.
- The app features a clean, user-friendly interface and dynamically displays images with photo credits.
